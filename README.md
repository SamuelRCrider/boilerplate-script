## 🔄 Updating

## 🗑 Uninstalling

If you need to uninstall Chiks:

1. Uninstall the package:

```bash
npm uninstall -g chiks
```

2. Remove the binary:

```bash
rm $(which chiks)
```

NOTE: Due to npm v7+, uninstall scripts won't work, so the package's preuninstall script cannot remove the binary from your system. That's why you need to manually remove the binary as shown above.
