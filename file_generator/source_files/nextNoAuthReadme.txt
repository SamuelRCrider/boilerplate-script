// Next.js App with No Auth

## General
- Note that docker is running, it just isn't shown in the terminal
- If a file is in the gitignore but isn't greyed out, try the following:
    1. delete and then retype a letter of the filename in the gitignore, save the gitignore file.
    2. No luck? Reload the developer window.
    3. No luck? The .env is probably in the staging area of git. Unstage it.
    4. Still no luck? Look it up or ask for help. (sorry lol)
- Note that a git repo has been initialized in the root directory of your project!
